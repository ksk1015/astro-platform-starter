## Developing Locally

| Prerequisites                                                                |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18.20.8+.                                    |
| (optional) [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for Node version management. |

1. Clone this repository, then run `npm install` in its root directory.

2. Recommended: link your local repository to a Netlify project. This will ensure you're using the same runtime version for both local development and your deployed project.

```
netlify link
```

3. Run the Astro.js development server:

```
npm run dev
```
